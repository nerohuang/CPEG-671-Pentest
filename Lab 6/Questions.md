# Lab 6 â€“ Shellcode

## 1. For lab6-1.asm, explain what system calls you used and describe how you chained them together to accomplish your goal.

    I using "sys_creat()" and "sys_write()" to create file and write into
    the file. After I created and opened the file, the file descriptor
    will be in eax, so I chained this two command by copy the file
    descriptor into ebx and apply that to sys_write.
