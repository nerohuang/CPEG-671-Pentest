# Lab3 â€“ Reverse Engineering using radare2

## 1. What is the correct password for lab3-1? Describe how the program generates this password.

    The password for lab3-1 is "^BK^]KYOKYS".
    The program will tansfer the charter in string "thatwaseasy" to ascii code.
    Then, use that ascii code exclusive or 42 and transfer back to charter.
    So we get "^BK^]KYOKYS".

## 2. What is the correct password for lab3-2? Describe how the program generates this password.

    The password for lab3-2 is "YSAESAWTAHT".
    The program will tansfer the charter in string "thatwaseasy" to ascii code but in reverse order.
    Then, use that ascii code subtract 32 and transfer back to charter.
    So we get "YSAESAWTAHT".

## 3. For lab3-1, what is the purpose of the local variable located at `ebp-0x20`?

    The local variable located at 'ebp-0x20', is signed int var_20h in program.
    It used to counter the loop and help program go through the string.

## 4. For lab3-2, what does the instruction `lea ecx, [eax - 0x20]` do, and why is it significant for this binary?

    It used to calcuated the value in eax subtract with 0x20 then put it into ecx.
    The value of eax is ascii code of the charter, so after code subtract 32, it 
    will make the lower case charter becomes captical.
