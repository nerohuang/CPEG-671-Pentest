# Lab 4 â€“ Reverse Engineering using a Debugger

## 1. What is the expected password? Describe how this password is generated by the program.

    The password is : 4 8 15 16 23 42.
    The password is store in var_28h and the "correct" value will append into it
    by order : 0x16452 0x16456 0x1645d 0x1645e 0x16465 0xfffe9bf8;

## 2. EXTRA CREDIT: What non-primitive data structure is being used in this program? How do you know this? HINT: 'array' is not the correct answer.

    I think the non-primitive data structure is queue, because it was a linear
    list and it was first in first out.

## 3. What is the inverse of the following operations: XOR, NOT, ADD, SUB?

    Inverse of XOR: XOR itself.
    Inverse of NOT: Not itself.
    Inverse of ADD: SUB.
    Inverse of SUB: ADD.

## 4. What is the purpose of the local variable located at `ebp - local_34h`?

    The local variable set 1 at the begining. It used to tracing weather the enter
    password is correct. If one of the enter password is wrong, it will change 1 
    to 0 and at the last "if" part to output "Incorrect". If all the enter 
    password is correct, it will keep as 1 and at the last "if" part, it will 
    output "Correct".

## 5. What does the use of `malloc` indicate about the memory location of a given variable?

    There is a code "push 8" before each 'malloc'. So each malloc will let program
    allocate 8 bytes for the following variables. The first number is 0x16452 will 
    store in address [var_28h], then, allocate 8 bytes to store the second value
    0x16456... and so on.
