# Lab 1 â€” Environment Setup and C Refresher

## Problems:

1. What vagrant command would you use to list the status of all virtual machines?

        vagrant global-status

2. For lab1-2.c, what is significant about the addresses of x and y? Why is this happening?

        The addresses of x and y is different and has 4 bytes differnt.
        Because the size of pointer is 4 bytes in 32bits system and 8 bytes in
        64 bits system.

3. For lab1-2.c, are the addresses of x and y the same each time the program is run? If yes, why? If not, why not?

        No, the addressess of x and y are not the same each time the program
        is run. Because everty time runs the program, the RAM will randomly
        give the addresses to x and y for safty.

4. For lab1-3.c, would an array of a different type affect how you accessed the array elements? (e.g if I told you to re-write the program using an array of doubles instead of integers, would it change how you accessed the array elements?)

        Just change the specifier to match the variable type, it will work
        find. Because I am using the address to get the value of each element,
        so it will always works.
