# Lab 5 â€“ Buffer Overflows

## 1. For lab5-1, describe how your input alters the execution path of the program.

    From the program, we knew the input value 'char *dest' address is 'ebp-0x20'. We also know
    if we need to get the Correct, we need to make value 'var_ch', which address is 'ebp-0xc'
    equal to '0xdeaddbeaf'. So I decide using 20 'A' charter to smash the stack because there
    are 20 bytes between 'ebp-0x20' and 'ebp-0xc'. Then, rewrite var_ch value to '0xdeadbeaf'.

## 2. For lab5-2, draw a diagram of the stack frame for the 'secure' function after the call to strcpy(). Highlight how your input alters the execution path of the program.

    See the picture.
