# Lab 7 – Return-Oriented Programming

## 1. Describe the reverse engineering procedure you used to write your solution script.

    I use ‘pattern create’ to create a large enough padding and run it to crash 
    the program and it can give us the right padding of the binary at the same time. 
    Then, I use ‘info function XXX’ to look for the address of the function we need 
    and use ‘searchmem ‘XXX’’ to look for elements that we need, also use "ropgadget" 
    to get the right ret address.

## 2. List all functions you used, their addresses, and why/how you used them. 

    I used : 
    "puts" : 0xf7e46290;
    "i" = 0xf7dd5be4;
    "did" = 0xf7ff46eb;
    "it" = 0x804827f;
    "!" = 0x804821c;

    popret = 0x8048351;
